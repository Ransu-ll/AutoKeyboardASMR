## What's this?
It's a website that plays mechanical keyboard [ASMR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASMR)!
## How do I use this?
1. Head on over to the [website](https://ransu-ll.github.io/AutoKeyboardASMR/)
2. Click the "play" button

It will then start playing key clicks.
## But why?
Because some people like ASMR from clicky keyboards!

I was inspired by a certain friend, who we'll call S, to create this!

## Warning
This is currently a major work in progress and is, as a result, currently in quite a crude state.
